       - REST 
           - [Rest Basic](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-enterprise-hub/tree/master/samples/VSCode_Extension/API-Development/REST/Basic) :  This sample demonstrates some of the REST features present in the FLOGO ReceiveHTTPMessage trigger and InvokeRestService activity
       - gRPC
           - [all-tls](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-enterprise-hub/tree/master/samples/VSCode_Extension/API-Development/gRPC/all-tls) : This sample demonstrates how to configure a gRPC server with mutual TLS authentication in Flogo and how to use the app-level spec to load the proto file for defining the gRPC service methods.
       - graphQL
           - [Basic](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-enterprise-hub/tree/master/samples/VSCode_Extension/API-Development/graphQL/Basic) : This sample demonstrates how to build a GraphQL server in Flogo using the GraphQL Trigger, with the schema defined via App-Level Spec support.
